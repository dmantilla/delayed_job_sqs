h1. Delayed Job for Amazon Simple Queue

h2. Running Jobs on the queue
<code>
	Delayed::Job.work_off(sqs_queue)
</code>
This will pull messages from the queue and delete the message after, if the execution was successful. 
Otherwise the message will remain on the queue.

h2. Displaying the messages awaiting execution
@Delayed::Job.list(sqs_queue)@ will return an array of the class and method to be executed.

@Deyaled::Job.expanded_list(sqs_queue)@ returns another array with a detailed view of the possible result of the execution. 
It's currently working for emails only. It gives a preview of each email being sent.
